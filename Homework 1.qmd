## Introduction

The **`mtcars`** is a classic dataset that is available in R. The data was extracted from the 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). (See [mtcars](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars) for more details).

Here we will explore the relationship between a car's miles per gallon (MPG) and its horsepower (HP).

## Data Overview

Below are some descriptive statistics of the variables used in the plot, of `mtcars` dataset:

```{r}
#| label: summary_df

# Loading necesssary libraries
# for ploting and for the dataset mtcars
library(ggplot2)
library(datasets)

# Loading the mtcars dataset
data("mtcars")

# Create a dataframe for summary statistics
# Round to 2 decimal units
summary_df <- data.frame(
  Statistic = c('Mean', 'Median', 'Standard Deviation'),
  MPG = round(c(mean(mtcars$mpg), median(mtcars$mpg), sd(mtcars$mpg)), 2),
  HP = round(c(mean(mtcars$hp), median(mtcars$hp), sd(mtcars$hp)), 2)
)

# Display the summary statitics dataframe
summary_df
```

## Scatter Plot

Below is the scatter plot of the variables *MPG* against *HP*. This plot can be used to visualize the effect of the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) change with respect to the horsepower of a car.

```{r}
#| label: plot
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between miles per gallon (MPG) and horsepower (HP) in mtcars dataset"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6

# Create the scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg)) +
  
  # Point plot
  geom_point() +
  
  # Line plot
  geom_line(col = 'red') +
  
  # Change x limit
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 350), breaks = seq(50, 350, by = 50)) +
  
  # Lables (title xlab and ylab)
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of MPG vs. HP",
    x = "Horsepower (HP)",
    y = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)"
  ) +
  
  # Set the theme for the plot
  theme_gray() +
  
  # Set title to center
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )
```

## Conclusion

From the above plot we can see that on moving right (when horsepower increases) the miles per gallon of the car tends to decrease, which implies that cars that are more powerful are typically less fuel efficient.
