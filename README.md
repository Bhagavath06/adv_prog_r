# Report Creation using R in Quarto

Using Quarto, creating a report which does not include the code snippet, but showing necessary outputs for some relevant questions.

Using the dataset `mtcars` available in R, the relationship between a car's miles per gallon (MPG) and its horsepower (HP) is depicted on the report.

We have created a summary statistics of the variables of interest and a scatter plot to show the relation between a car's MPG and HP, and these output are included on the report.

**Note**: To make a `.pdf` report, just render the quarto document. <br/>
To create a `.html` report, in the `YAML` file header, change `format: html` and render the quarto file.
